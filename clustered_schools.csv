The College of Medicine offers a Doctor of Medicine (MD) program. The College of Medicine (COM) is committed to meet the nation’s need for physicians with an emphasis on training in primary care with social accountability.

CNUCOM is dedicated to educating students to become competent, patient-centered healthcare professionals. Education is provided using an innovative, integrated, clinical presentation based curriculum. The graduates of CNUCOM will have the knowledge and skills to perform as a physician and to work in a multi professional environment. The graduates will be well prepared to meet the health and medical challenges in the 21st century.

As a result of several recent publications and studies which indicated the need for an increase in the number of primary care physicians trained in California, senior operations staff at the College of Pharmacy began discussions for a new medical school in the greater Sacramento area early in the spring of 2010. With recent federal health care initiatives in combination with the needs of the aging baby-boomer population, primary care physicians are seeing everincreasing patient loads. It was also recognized that as a result of the financial crisis facing California, the State has been unable to increase the number of medical students trained within the State. CNUCOM will directly help the primary care physician shortage in California.

It is the goal of the University to create life-long learners that are trained to serve the community as leaders in health care science, education, and research. With this goal in mind, senior University officials have developed a strategic plan that addresses education, partnership, and scholarship.

Much of the preliminary design of the structure of the College of Medicine and its curriculum was in place by June/July 2011. As part of this process, community leaders in medicine within the Sacramento Valley were engaged in a series of meetings to plan the outlines and address the key issues to be covered within the medical school curriculum. This core group established broad outlines of the curriculum and structure of the College of Medicine and also served as members of the Institutional Self-Study Task Force. They were visionary and demanded that this new school stress areas of training frequently ignored or understated by many medical schools. Many members brought 20-30 years of experience in direct medical practice in the highly competitive Sacramento region to provide insight on how to best train future physicians. They noted that our nation is poised to institute new schemes for providing universal health care to its citizens and, at the same time, provide care that is high quality, cost-effective, and evidence-based.

Given disparities in access to healthcare services in the U.S. and the entry of more patients into the healthcare system with the recent introduction of the Affordable Care Act, there is a widely recognized need for more healthcare workers and biomedical professionals. Likewise, strong local demand for undergraduate education in health sciences by California high school graduates necessitates the creation of additional programs in this area. These factors have combined to support the creation of a third college at CNU that will educate students qualified for admission to postbaccalaureate schools seeking to pursue health sciences careers. Thus, the creation of the College of Health Sciences’ Bachelor of Science degree program aligns with CNU’s mission, purpose and strategic intent, “To advance the science and art of healthcare.”",https://medicine.cnsu.edu/,"Provisional, on probation",2015,34,"california, inland, riverside, medical, southern"

The purpose of the California University of Science and Medicine is to develop and operate a health and life sciences university, including colleges, a research institute, and a graduate school of medicine, to educate future physicians and medical support personnel and conduct medical research and/or work with research organizations to further the science and art of medicine. Additionally, the university may engage in any activities reasonably related to or in furtherance of its stated purposes.

Vision Statement
To establish a school of medicine that inspires, motivates, and empowers students to become excellent and caring physicians, scientists, and leaders, advance the art and science of medicine through research, improve the health of its community, share innovative curriculum, and promote best practices in medical education globally, and facilitates a medical education to promising disadvantaged students, especially from California and the Inland Empire.

Mission Statement
To advance the art and science of medicine through innovative medical education, research, and compassionate healthcare delivery in an inclusive environment that advocates critical thinking, creativity, integrity, and professionalism.

Diversity Statement
CUSM strives to cultivate a culture in which everyone is valued in an environment of inclusive excellence, equity practice, and equitable support. Diversity is integral to the California University of Science and Medicine's institutional identity, as evidenced in the founding principles. This early intent to create a historic medical school in southern California has arisen from tenets adopted by the inaugural leadership. It begins with a deep commitment to the diversity of the student body, faculty, administration, and staff. Recognizing and nurturing latent merit, talent, values, and richness inherent in our diverse California culture and society, CUSM leadership acknowledged the need to remove barriers to recruiting, retaining, and advancing historically excluded, underrepresented, and marginalized populations. This is being achieved through the CUSM mission to serve diverse, disadvantaged, and multicultural populations and to meet the health needs of the people of the Inland Empire, the State of California, and the Nation. The innovative clinical presentation curriculum emphasizes public health, population health, global health, and affordable, accessible care for all. Educational excellence incorporating diversity can promote mutual respect, equity, practice skills, and manifest the full talents and abilities to serve patients better and foster innovation and leadership. Training culturally humble and structurally competent healthcare providers requires a multicultural milieu in which diversity, equity, and inclusion are deeply valued, encouraged, and integrated into all facets of the institution. This philosophy is at the core of CUSM, and it enriches the experiences gained by students while building values of altruism, activism, leadership, and social accountability in the globalized, pluralistic, complex, connected world of the 21st century.",https://www.cusm.edu/,Provisional,2018,34,"california, inland, riverside, medical, southern"

VP&S provides international leadership in educating physicians, physician-scientists, and research scientists; in caring for patients ranging from those who can select any physician in the world to our neighborhood's most vulnerable residents; and in conducting basic, translational, and population-based research to improve human health.

One of the nation's most research-intensive medical schools, VP&S is consistently ranked among the best medical schools in the nation. VP&S attracts students with idealistic values and the highest aspirations for excellence. Students have MCAT scores and grade point averages that are among the highest in the nation, and VP&S has one of the most diverse student bodies of any medical school in the U.S. Also, our graduate research programs have been judged among the most productive as measured by their scholarly contributions.

We are living at a unique time in biomedical history. We've seen a revolution in complementary forces that are helping us change the way we think of medicine.

For the first time, we have a complete ""parts list"" of genes and other building blocks, which means we can personalize therapies. At the same time, we have an AI revolution that lets us gather data, mine it and visualize it in sophisticated ways, and act on it in real time in the ICU or predict problems with anticipatory medicine. And new technology allows us to probe the human organism through imaging and other areas, to visualize what's going on. Add to those the twenty-first century patients, who are well-informed, empowered, and incredible advocates for change.

These forces are converging to allow us to take on the big problems, and have a good chance of finding solutions to ones that have frustrated us for so long.

Uniquely positioned to make a difference
Embedded within Emory University, we have links to the business school, the department of chemistry, and many other academic resources that are traditionally outside the realm of health care. We have hospitals where we teach the next generation of health professionals to provide the most advanced, compassionate patient care. We have research institutes and government and industry partnerships racing to find the next discovery or cure.

We have all of this in one location, with a structure that allows those important interdisciplinary interactions to occur. With these resources and our team of bold thinkers who are willing to take risks in order to achieve something great, we believe there are no limits to what we can accomplish.

Our Mission
The Emory University School of Medicine is a leading institution with the highest standards in education, biomedical research, and patient care.

We are committed to recruiting and developing a diverse group of students and innovative leaders in biomedical science, public health, medical education, and clinical care.

We foster a culture that integrates leading edge basic, translational, and clinical research to further the ability to deliver quality health care, to predict illness and treat the sick, and to promote health of our patients and community.

Objectives
Provide outstanding educational programs for medical and graduate students and for training health care professionals

Develop outstanding clinicians and investigators who are lifelong learners, who will provide the highest quality compassionate care, and who will serve the needs of their community and the world in the best traditions of our profession

Mission Statement
The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai advances science, medicine, and health care delivery for the benefit of humanity through a culture of excellence, innovation, collaboration, and belonging. We conduct groundbreaking research; educate and nurture the next generation of exceptional clinicians, researchers, teachers, and leaders; and deliver the most advanced compassionate care with an unwavering commitment to health equity.

Our Vision
We pursue innovative approaches to education, research, and patient care, combining the best traditions of biomedicine and health care delivery with the principles and entrepreneurial thinking of a startup, to uncover novel insights about disease and health. Building this culture of innovation requires making large investments and taking a transformative approach to discovery, which means taking risks and disrupting the status quo. In this way, we are transforming the practice of medicine while reinventing medical research to produce radically better outcomes for patients.

We seek students who can contribute open-mindedness, empathy, broad thinking, and medical, scientific, technological, and engineering expertise to change the very nature of biomedicine. We have developed a number of admissions and training programs to foster these advances and recruit multitalented students.

We continually pioneer innovative approaches in our medical and graduate education curricula that instill entrepreneurism, encourage critical thinking, and equip the next generation of basic and clinical scientists with leading-edge methodological and technological skills to translate scientific discovery into practice and improve public health.

We have ambitious goals, preparing scientists, physicians, and leaders who will make significant contributions to local and global health care, remaining forever inquisitive in their quest for lifelong growth, learning, and contribution. We train in the classroom and the laboratory, at the bedside, and in the community. Our unwavering commitment to intellectual exchange, multidisciplinary teamwork, and innovation continually drives us forward in discoveries, advances, and service.

As a leader in biomedical research, we have hired highly accomplished scientists and executives with startup experience and melded them with Mount Sinai’s doctors and researchers, spurring new levels of collaboration among our faculty. We are an engine of discovery, creating new treatments for the patients who need them the most, working in partnership with leading high-tech companies. We are on the threshold of a new era in precision medicine, and our mission is to cure diseases once thought incurable, changing the lives of patients worldwide.

A Foundation of Service
Our values are deeply ingrained in the School. When our School’s doors opened in 1968, our founding trustees envisioned a new and progressive institution, embedded within the real-world environment of a working hospital. They called for the levels of passion, inquiry, dedication, knowledge, leadership, and innovation for which the School is renowned.

Today, we train nearly 2,000 students and postdoctoral fellows and more than 2,600 clinical residents and fellows each year, with a faculty of 4,500 full-time and part-time scientists, educators, and clinicians working within and across 38 academic departments and 45 multidisciplinary institutes.

The school attracts students and faculty committed to making a difference in patient care, research, education and public service — at home and across the globe. 

The School of Medicine and Temple University Hospital (TUH), its chief clinical training site, provide care for patients from throughout the region seeking advanced tertiary- and quaternary-level care. In addition, Temple University Hospital is Pennsylvania’s premier safety net provider, located in America’s largest city without a public hospital.

With clinical training sites that include other member hospitals and specialty centers of the Temple University Health System and educational affiliates of the School of Medicine, medical students gain experience in a variety of urban, suburban, and rural in- and out-patient settings. They learn to provide culturally competent, interprofessional care to a diverse population of patients with simple conditions as well as highly complex ones. 

The Lewis Katz School of Medicine is a school that prizes not just technical excellence but diversity, equality and inclusion. It teaches the true art and science of “doctoring.“ Moreover, its educational strategic plan, “Improving Health Through Innovation in Medical Education,” keeps pace with new medical knowledge and with emerging trends in care delivery.

The school’s home base in Philadelphia is a spectacular 11-story, 480,000 square-foot medical education and research building that features state-of-the-art facilities and technologies for medical education and research. With specialized research centers focused on population health, metabolic disease, cancer, heart disease and other strategic priorities, the school conducts investigations to break new ground – and trains future generations of researchers to follow suit.

On October 13, 2015, Temple's medical school was officially dedicated as the Lewis Katz School of Medicine – a historic milestone in the school’s history. Thousands of people participated in events celebrating this change which, Dean Dr. Larry Kaiser said, ""joins our school’s legacy to the values that Lewis lived by, and the values which we have always tried to instill in our students – hard work, dedication, service.""

The school was founded in 1931 with a dual mission of training outstanding doctors who are committed to care for the underserved and providing excellent healthcare for the people of Louisiana. What began as a small School of Medicine has now grown into a major Health Sciences Center with five other schools (Dentistry, Nursing, Allied Health, Public Health and Graduate Studies), but our commitment to excellence in patient care and service to our community continues today. Our faculty, residents and students also work to advance medical science - whether making exciting discoveries in the laboratory, studying new treatments in our clinics, or understanding how our delivery system can improve health equity. I encourage you to take a closer look at our school. I believe you will find what you seek in your education and training.

Whether you come to LSU Health New Orleans for medical school or residency, you will learn to be an outstanding physician. We have a rich history of medical education that dates to the historic 2000-bed Charity Hospital. We have replaced Charity with a new University Medical Center, New Orleans. This 1.5 million square foot hospital won architectural recognition for its use of natural light, custom artwork, and integration of outdoor spaces. Its very design enhances comfort, healing and dignity for our patients, and it serves as our primary teaching hospital for adult care. Our outstanding faculty will help you become a physician who practices with compassion, depth of knowledge, critical thinking, and technical proficiency. You will also learn the practice of medicine within the social context of community needs and you will learn the importance of providing excellent care for all, including underserved populations.

The medical school curriculum integrates clinical and basic science teaching from day one. Skills training in our Student Learning Center and Center for Advance Practice simulation labs also begins early in the first year. Our health equity curriculum will challenge you to understand the roots of health disparities and inspire you to find solutions. Interested students have opportunities to explore those challenges on a deeper level and gain real-world experience in health policy. Our students may do their third and fourth-year clinical rotations in New Orleans, or at regional campuses in Baton Rouge and Lafayette. All are outstanding learning environments with dedicated teachers, a diverse patient population, and a wide range of disease conditions from which to learn.

We have over 900 residents and fellows in over 65 different accredited programs. Our residents train at a broad range of hospitals in New Orleans and across the southern regions of the State. This diversity of academic and community-based training sites provides a rich learning experience, and our residents treat patients from all walks of life. All training programs utilize our simulation centers for skills training, and residents have access to state-of-the art CME courses that teach the latest innovations in patient care and surgical procedures. We have been leaders in simulation for more than 20 years, and our recently opened CALS building (Center for Advanced Learning and Simulation) expands our simulation capacity. This $65,000,000 project will allow us to develop innovative programs in mass trauma simulation, doctor-patient communication, robotics, and other advanced training.
